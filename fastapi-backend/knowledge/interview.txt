Susan’s story:
Working as a researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Susan initially believed she would study the keys to success and what contributes to individuals becoming valuable members of society. However, she soon realized the focus was on illness and dysfunction. Undeterred by the laughter of senior psychologists when they expressed their opposing viewpoints, she remained steadfast and embarked on a mission to study successful people and uncover their unique skill sets. Through a serendipitous encounter with Buckminster Fuller, a renowned architect, Susan began her journey of learning and sharing skills with others.


The importance of believing in your dreams:
Susan emphasizes the importance of believing in your dreams. She highlights the significance of being open to unconventional ideas, as they often hold the potential for remarkable breakthroughs, and the practice of success filing, where people foster a sense of self-worth and motivation by taking the time to acknowledge their daily achievements and milestones. She also stresses the power of celebrating the successes of others, as that creates a positive and supportive environment that uplifts individuals and teams.


Promising ideas often get dismissed:
With extensive experience in corporate boardrooms and collaborating with numerous CEOs, Susan gained a profound understanding of the unfortunate reality where promising ideas frequently get dismissed and ridiculed, resulting in their failure to materialize.


Success filing:
One of the skills Susan observed among successful individuals is what she refers to as success filing. It involves taking time each day to acknowledge your accomplishments, regardless of how insignificant they may seem. Success filing allows people to recognize their progress and build a positive mindset. Engaging in success filing only requires a few minutes of reflection to review the day’s actions, thoughts, lessons learned, and beneficial encounters. That practice cultivates self-awareness, motivation, and a sense of accomplishment.

Success:
Most people have never taken the time to define what success truly means to them. In exploring the concept, Susan discovered a three-fold understanding of success from conversations with successful people. Those individuals described success as encompassing three essential components. The first is completion, which involves finishing tasks and projects and acknowledging the accomplishment. The second is deletion, which refers to recognizing when a particular approach or strategy is not working and letting go of it to explore alternative paths. Finally, success can involve creation, where individuals can identify and commit to viable and innovative ideas and take action to bring them to fruition.

Flexibility:
Flexibility and adaptability are essential when approaching challenges or pursuing goals. Many people repeat the same actions and encounter the same obstacles without considering alternative approaches. Recognizing the need for a shift in strategy is crucial. It involves acknowledging the value of your ideas while being open to modifying them to better align with the situation at hand. You also need to know when to let go of an approach that is not working.

Envisioning your success to perform better:
By programming your brain’s reticular activating system correctly, you can tap into your unconscious abilities and perform better. However, if you dwell on old painful memories or have been through a series of negative experiences, fear could dominate your thinking, leading to constant anticipation of negative outcomes.
