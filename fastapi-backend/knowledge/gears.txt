Success is completion. Success is deletion. Success is also creation and cocreation. When your Success File is full, you feel success-full. Success in your past gives you confidence in your future.

First Gear is learning the basics. In First Gear, you depend on a leader to guide you step by step, whether in person, on the phone, or in writing, as you begin to use your new skill safely and correctly. Then your friend goes home and you start practicing on your own. Because it may not seem as clear now as it did when she was there beside you, you call her to ask specific questions as you continue to build your new skill. Now instead of just trying to get on the Internet, you begin using it tofind information and people. It's easier and faster now, except for occasional glitches that require an additional call or visit.

Second Gear is moving ahead to why you wanted to learn it in the first place-so you could use it. Confident and experienced, you pursue your goals and interests more efficiently. The next time you talk to your friend, you catch yourself sharing discoveries you've made and telling her how to use them.

Third Gear is breaking through what you've been taught - the beginner set of rules and limits-to create your own way and pass on your discoveries. Now you take on your own student, teach him the basics, help him get up and running, and creative. And then he teaches a friend... This is how the Success and Leadership Process works - ideally.

Success in First Gear is following rules and earning praise.
Success in Second Gear is producing results and getting ahead.
Success in Third Gear is creating *your* dreams, alone and with others.

To lead your life skillfully you need to manually shift up and down as circumstances and conditions require, just as a skillful driver does.
