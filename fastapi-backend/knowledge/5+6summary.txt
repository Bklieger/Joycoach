(A)
You are the conductor of your own dream. Lead people to the third gear. Search for both codreamers, people who can support and understand your dream, and cooperators, experts who can aid you in your dream.

It is worthwhile to invest your time in finding experts and resources. Ensure you contribute to position them where they are able to help you. However, you should have backup experts, as one person will not know everything, and you shouold have a group of people to consult. Do not undervalue your friends, coaches, and mentors. Some will be experts behind-the-scenes.

(B)
Sharing your dream with others is important, and you should give people all the information: the what, when, where, why, and how. They can assist you in filling in the gaps and evolving your dream.

To be successful, you complete something, but it is also a commitment to a dream. Third-gear leaders have discretion to provide the space for experts to step up and achieve their dreams. You should remember that the success of others is also your success.

(C)
Success can be understood also as deletion-- you should release your past so you can stay on course. We all have things from our past that prevent us from accomplishing our goals. 

Re-viewing, re-thinking, re-deciding, re-leasing, re-dreaming, are all important.

Look for places you avoid and fear, places you have failed repeatedly, where others upset us. This is where you should focus on releasing your past.

(D)
Deal with upsets in the moment, do not let them be unattended, for they will cause issues in the future.
“Old upsets are set ups for upsets in the moment”
Successful people update memories based upon what they know and do now. Re-experiencing and re-deciding based upon an updated perspective.
