Part one focuses on : What They Didn’t Tell You About Success— that You Need to Know while Part Two dwells on : The Rest of the Skills You Will Need— to Make the Changes You Want

In Part one  Susan explains the meaning of Success and how it affects one personally.

Success is completion of what you set out to do.  No matter how big or small the task may seem, the satisfaction you get when you complete it determines your level of success.  She also mentions that

Success is being able to let go of an unworkable method or system. An outgrown relationship you’ve tried everything conceivable to fix. A well-paying job you’ve done the same way far too many times.
Success is quitting smoking or giving up caffeine, sugar, or drugs; or letting go of your society-rewarded addiction to old rules, hard work, money, or power.
Success is cutting out, down, or back.

How a person defines success varies from person to person and the definition is certainly not universal. To attain success is to be able to reach ones’ dream.

Having a detailed dream makes it easier to act on.  The more detailed your dream is the more power it has.

With a plan in mind it is easier for one to move towards the goal/dreams to obtain success.
